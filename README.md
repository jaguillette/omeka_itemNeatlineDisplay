# Item Neatline Display Plugin
This fairly simple plugin adds a metadata set that allows for embedding Neatline exhibits in Item Pages. To add a Neatline exhibit to an item, go to the "Neatline Display" element set, and set the Neatline Exhibit to the slug of the exhibit you want to embed, and optionally add a record number, to display that record by default.

This plugin may not interact well with your exhibit, particularly if you have a Simile timeline or waypoints, as it may show up very small.
